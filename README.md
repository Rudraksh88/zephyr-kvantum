# Credits
I want to acknowledge the following individuals and projects that influenced this work:

* [tsujan](https://github.com/tsujan) for creating Kvantum, the SVG-based theme engine for Qt
* [Patrik Wyde](https://github.com/pwyde) for creating [Monochrome-KDE](https://github.com/pwyde/monochrome-kde), which served as initial inspiration

### Project Evolution
I initially started by modifying and tweaking [Patrik Wyde](https://github.com/pwyde)'s [Monochrome-KDE](https://github.com/pwyde/monochrome-kde) theme. As I continued to make changes, the project evolved significantly, becoming a distinct theme in its own right. This transformation led me to release it as a separate project.
While this theme has grown into its own unique work, I want to express my gratitude to these open-source contributors. Their efforts provided the foundation that allowed me to create this new theme.
